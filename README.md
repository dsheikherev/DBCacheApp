# DataBase-Cache App (iOS)

## Description

This app is made as part of my iOS development training.<br /> 

It simulates some Database. Making changes in Database is only allowed via Cache.<br />
You can copy entries from Database one-by-one. 

Allowed changes in Cache are:
* Add new child entry to existing parent
* Change value of entry
* Remove entry
